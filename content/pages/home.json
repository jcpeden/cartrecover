We offer a couple of different packages ranging from a DIY option for small stores through to a more bespoke service if you're really busy and just want us to set up an automated recovery sequence for you.\n\n## Why you should care\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is, it's actually really straightforward to set up a cart abandonment email marketing sequence. Many stores are losing over 70% of their customers after they add products to their shopping cart so even recovering just a small percentage of them can really add up."
