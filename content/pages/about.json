The average site loses around 70% of all of its shopping carts after a customer adds products to their basket and the effects are quite remarkable if you're able to recover even a small percentage of these.\n\nIf you're a smaller store, we can provide you with a template pack and tell you how to set up an abandoned cart recover sequence yourself. If you're a little larger, we can customise the emails to use your site's branding and your store's USPs. \n\nIf you're larger still or just don't want the hassle of setting up your email autoresponder then we can even set up and manage that for you too.\n\nIf you're running a Shopify store and you'd like to recover an of your lost sales, then we can help. Just use the contact link to get in touch.",
